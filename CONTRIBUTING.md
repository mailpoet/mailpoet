There is a `./do` command that helps with the development process. See README.md for more details.

## PHP Code

- Two spaces indentation.
- Space between keyword (if, for, switch...) and left bracket
- CamelCase for classes.
- camelCase for methods.
- snake_case for variables and class properties.
- Composition over Inheritance.
- Comments are a code smell. If you need to use a comment - see if same idea can be achieved by more clearly expressing code.
- Require other classes with 'use' at the beginning of the class file.
- Do not specify 'public' if method is public, it's implicit.
- Always use guard clauses.
- Ensure compatibility with PHP 7.1 and newer versions.
- Cover your code in tests.

## SCSS Code

- camelCase for file name
- Components files are prefixed with underscore, to indicate, that they aren't compiled separately.

## JS Code

- Javascript code should follow the [Airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
- Prefer named export before default export in JS and TS files

## Disabling linting rules

- we want to avoid using `eslint-disable`
- if we have to use it we need to use a comment explaining why do we need it:
  `/* eslint-disable no-new -- this class has a side-effect in the constructor and it's a library's. */`
- for PHP we do the same with the exception `// phpcs:ignore Squiz.NamingConventions.ValidVariableName.MemberNotCamelCaps` which for now doesnâ€™t require an explanation

## Git flow

- Do not commit to trunk.
- Open a short-living feature branch.
- Open a pull request.
- Add Jira issue reference in the title of the Pull Request.
- Work on the pull request.
- Use the `./do qa` command to check your code style before pushing.
- Use good commit messages as explained here https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit
- Wait for review from another developer.

## Issues creation

- Issues are managed on Jira.
- Discuss issues on public Slack chats, discuss code in pull requests.
- Open a small Jira issue only when it has been discussed.

## Feature flags

We use feature flags to control the visibility of new features. This allows us to work on new features in smaller chunks before they are released to all customers.

- Feature flags can be enabled on the experimental page: wp-admin/admin.php?page=mailpoet-experimental
- New feature flags can be added in the class `FeaturesController`
