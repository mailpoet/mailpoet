## PHP Code
- Two spaces indentation.
- Space between keyword (if, for, switch...) and left bracket
- CamelCase for classes.
- camelCase for methods.
- snake_case for variables and class properties.
- Composition over Inheritance.
- Comments are a code smell. If you need to use a comment - see if same idea can be achieved by more clearly expressing code.
- Require other classes with 'use' at the beginning of the class file.
- Do not specify 'public' if method is public, it's implicit.
- Always use guard clauses.
- Ensure compatibility with PHP 7.1 and newer versions.
- Cover your code in tests.

## SCSS Code
- camelCase for file name
- Components files are prefixed with underscore, to indicate, that they aren't compiled separately.

- Prefer named export before default export in JS and TS files
