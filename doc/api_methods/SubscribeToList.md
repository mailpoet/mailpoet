# Subscribe to List

## `array subscribeToList(string $subscriber_id, string $list_id [, array $options = []])`

This method allows adding an existing subscriber into a list, and handles confirmation email and admin notification email sending.

This method works exactly the same as [Subscribe to lists](SubscribeToLists.md). The only difference is the second argument which is a single list id.
