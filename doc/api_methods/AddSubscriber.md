# Add Subscriber

## `array addSubscriber(array $subscriber [, array $list_ids = [], array $options = []])`

This method allows a subscriber to be created, adds them into lists, and handles confirmation email and admin notification email sending and welcome email scheduling.

If sign-up confirmation (double opt-in) is enabled in the MailPoet settings a subscriber is created with status `unconfirmed` otherwise the status is set to `subscribed`.

- *A confirmation email* is an email which is sent to a subscriber so that they can confirm his subscription. It is sent only if sign-up confirmation is enabled in the MailPoet settings.
- *A welcome email* is an automatic email which is sent to a new subscriber. This email is scheduled only if sign-up confirmation is disabled and a welcome email is configured for some of given lists. In case of required sign-up confirmation, it is scheduled later after a subscriber confirms the subscription.
- *An admin notification email* is sent to the site admin to inform them about a new subscription. It is sent only if the notification feature is enabled in the MailPoet setting.

All these emails can be disabled using `$options`.

A subscriber can be added only once. This method throws an `\Exception` in case of adding an existing subscriber.
This method also throws an `\Exception` in case that some of `$list_ids` is invalid. In such a case a subscriber is created, but is not subscribed to any list.
There might be other `\Exceptions` because of some invalid input data such a invalid email address etc.

It returns a new subscriber. See [Get Subscriber](GetSubscriber.md) for a subscriber data structure.

## Arguments
### `$subscriber` (required)

An associative array containing subscriber data which contains default properties (email, first_name, last_name) and custom subscriber fields which were defined in MailPoet.
It has to contain an email and all required custom fields. To get defined custom fields see [Get Subscriber Fields](GetSubscriberFields.md)

| Property | Type | Limits | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| email (required) | string | 150 chars | a valid email address |
| first_name (optional) | string/null | 255 chars | Fist name of the subscriber. |
| last_name (optional) | string/null | 255 chars  |  Last name of the subscriber. |
| cf_* (optional/required) | string/boolean/null | 65K chars  | A custom field (see [Get Subscriber Fields](GetSubscriberFields.md)). <br> If a custom field is a checkbox, send truthy or falsy value (`true`/`false, `1`/`0` or `"1"`\`"0"`). |

### `$list_ids` (optional)
An array containing list ids into which subscriber will be added.
In case that the list is empty a subscriber will be created; but sending a confirmation email, notification email and scheduling welcome email will be skipped.

### `$options` (optional)
All options are optional. If omitted a default value is used.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| send_confirmation_email | boolean | true | Can be used to disable a confirmation email. Otherwise, a confirmation email is sent as described above. It is strongly recommended to keep this option set to `true` so that MailPoet settings for sign-up confirmation are respected. Turning it to `false` might lead that subscriber to be added as `unconfirmed`. |
| schedule_welcome_email | boolean | true | Can be used to disable a welcome email. Otherwise, a welcome email is scheduled as described above.|
| skip_subscriber_notification | boolean | false | Can be used to disable an admin notification email. Otherwise, an admin notification email is sent as described above.|

## Error handling

All expected errors from the API are exceptions of class `\MailPoet\API\MP\v1\APIException`.
