# Subscribe to Lists

## `array subscribeToLists(string $subscriber_id, array $list_ids [, array $options = []])`

This method allows adding an existing subscriber into lists and handles confirmation email and admin notification email sending.

- _A confirmation email_ is an email which is sent to a subscriber so they can confirm their subscription. It is sent only if sign-up confirmation is enabled in MailPoet settings and subscriber has not received any confirmation email yet.
- _A welcome email_ is an automatic email which is sent to a new subscriber. This email is scheduled only if sign-up confirmation is disabled and some welcome email is configured for some of given lists.
- _An admin notification email_ is sent to the site admin to inform them about a new subscription. It is sent only if the notification feature is enabled in the MailPoet setting.

All these emails can be disabled using `$options`.

It returns a subscriber. See [Get Subscriber](GetSubscriber.md) for a subscriber data structure.
