# MailPoet

The **MailPoet** plugin monorepo.

To use our Docker-based development environment (recommended), continue with the steps below.
If you'd like to use the plugin code directly, see details in [the plugin's readme](mailpoet/README.md).

## üîå Initial setup

1. Run `./do setup` to pull everything and install necessary dependencies.
2. Add secrets to `.env` files in `mailpoet` and `mailpoet-premium` directories. Go to the Secret Store and look for "MailPoet: plugin .env"
3. Run `./do start` to start the stack.
4. Go to http://localhost:8888 to see the dashboard of the dev environment.

## üîç PHPStorm setup for XDebug

In `Languages & Preferences > PHP > Servers` set path mappings:

```shell
wordpress        -> /var/www/html
mailpoet         -> /var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/mailpoet
mailpoet-premium -> /var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/mailpoet-premium
```

For PHP 8 and XDebug 3 we support **browser debugging extension**.
You can choose extension by your browser in [JetBrains documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/browser-debugging-extensions.html).

To use XDebug inside the **cron**, you need to pass a URL argument `&XDEBUG_TRIGGER=yes`
[in the cron request](https://github.com/mailpoet/mailpoet/blob/bf7bd6d2d9090ed6ec7b8b575bb7d6b08e663a52/lib/Cron/CronHelper.php#L155-L166).
Alternatively, you can add `XDEBUG_TRIGGER: yes` to the `wordpress` service in `docker-compose.yml` and restart it (which will run XDebug also for all other requests).

## Xdebug develop mode

[Xdebug develop mode](https://xdebug.org/docs/develop) is disabled by default because it causes performance issues due to conflicts with the DI container.

It can be enabled when needed using the `XDEBUG_MODE` environment variable. For example, it is possible to enable it by adding the following to `docker-compose.override.yml`:

```
environment:
    XDEBUG_MODE: debug, develop
```

## üíæ NFS volume sharing for Mac

NFS volumes can bring more stability and performance on Docker for Mac. To setup NFS volume sharing run:

```shell
sudo sh dev/mac-nfs-setup.sh
```

Then create a Docker Compose override file with NFS settings and restart containers:

```shell
cp docker-compose.override.macos-sample.yml docker-compose.override.yml

docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans
docker-compose up -d
```

**NOTE:** If you are on MacOS Catalina or newer, make sure to put the repository
outside your `Documents` folder, otherwise you may run into [file permission issues](https://objekt.click/2019/11/docker-the-problem-with-macos-catalina/).

# üê∂ Husky

We use [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to run automated checks in pre-commit hooks.

In case you're using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Node version management you may
need to create or update your `~/.huskyrc` file with:

```sh
# This loads nvm.sh and sets the correct PATH before running the hooks:
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

Without it, you may experience errors in some Git clients.

## üïπ Commands

The `./do` script define aliases for most of the commands you will need while working on plugins:

```shell
./do setup                           Setup the environment.
./do start                           Start the docker containers.
./do stop                            Stop the docker containers.
./do ssh [--test]                    Run an interactive bash shell inside the plugin directory.
./do run [--test] <command>          Run a custom bash command in the wordpress container.
./do acceptance [--premium]          Run acceptance tests.
./do build [--premium]               Builds a .zip for the plugin.
./do templates                       Generates templates classes and assets.
./do [--test] [--premium] <command>  Run './do <command>' inside the plugin directory.

Options:
   --test     Run the command using the 'test_wordpress' service.
   --premium  Run the command inside the premium plugin.
```

You can access this help in your command line running `./do` without parameters.

## ‚úâÔ∏è Adding new templates to the plugin

## üö• Testing with PHP 7.4 or PHP 8.0

To switch the environment to PHP 7.4/8.0:

1. Configure the `wordpress` service in `docker-compose.override.yml` to build from the php74 Dockerfile:

   ```yaml
   wordpress:
     build:
       context: .
       dockerfile: docker/php74/Dockerfile # OR docker/php80/Dockerfile
   ```

2. Run `docker-compose build wordpress`.
3. Start the stack with `./do start`.

To switch back to PHP 8.1 remove what was added in 1) and, run `docker-compose build wordpress` for application container and `docker-compose build test_wordpress` for tests container,
and start the stack using `./do start`.

## ‚úÖ TODO

- install woo commerce, members and other useful plugins by default
