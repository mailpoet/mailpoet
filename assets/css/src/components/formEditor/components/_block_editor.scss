// There is no way to hide the delete button programmatically so we hide last toolbar that contains the delete option
// There is a feature request for adding that into Gutenberg https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/16364
// We also hide options to prevent removing Email or Submit when they are in multi-select
