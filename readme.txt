To help your sending go without a hitch, we’ve created an advanced email delivery infrastructure built for WordPress. Our technology allows you to:

* Reach Inboxes, not Spam Boxes
* Send your emails super fast (up to 50,000 emails per hour)
* Get all your emails automatically signed with SPF & DKIM

The MailPoet Sending Service is very easy to setup, you just have to enter a key in your WordPress admin and you’re all set!

= Does MailPoet store the data of the user's subscribers? =

We do not store or keep any data from your subscribers. However, if you're sending with us, we do process all the emails to be sent. It means MailPoet only logs email addresses to ensure that our service runs effectively. We do not track anything else.

We suggest that you also add a link to our Privacy Notice in your own Privacy Notice page. What's important is to make sure that your subscribers are aware that MailPoet delivers your email, if you send with MailPoet that is.

You can also read our [Guide to Conform to GDPR](https://kb.mailpoet.com/article/246-guide-to-conform-to-gdpr).
