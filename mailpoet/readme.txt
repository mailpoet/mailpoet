* Convert more customers by sending a series of abandoned cart emails.

And with WooCommerce-specific segmentation options, you’ll be able to send targeted emails to your customers based on criteria such as their country, the number of orders they’ve placed, how much they’ve spent, and if they have an active product subscription (powered by WooCommerce Subscriptions) or membership (powered by WooCommerce Memberships).

In addition, you’ll also be able to increase brand recognition by customizing your WooCommerce transactional emails. Create a unified brand experience by changing the layout, colors, and fonts used in your emails, as well as adding any images or additional information to them.

= MailPoet Sending Service =

**The MailPoet Sending Service is free for your first 1,000 subscribers, with scaling plans available thereafter. [Read more.](https://www.mailpoet.com/pricing/)**

Sending emails and newsletters with your host is not a good idea. You might face sending speed limitations and see your emails ending up in the spam box.

To help your sending go without a hitch, we’ve created an advanced email delivery infrastructure built for WordPress. Our technology allows you to:

* Reach inboxes, not spam boxes
* Send your emails super fast (up to 50,000 emails per hour)
* Maintain your sender reputation and improve engagement levels with automated bounce and complaint handling. Stop sending to non-deliverable and complaining addresses, automatically
* Authenticate your emails (with SPF and DKIM) to improve deliverability and avoid spam boxes.

The MailPoet Sending Service is very easy to set up, you just have to enter a key in your WordPress dashboard and you’re all set!

= MailPoet plans and pricing =

MailPoet is available to download for free. Our free download includes all of the features listed above (with the exception of those indicating a plan requirement) under the following criteria:

* Up to 1,000 subscribers
* MailPoet branding in emails
* Send emails with your own sending method (host, SendGrid, Amazon SES, etc).

Or if you opt for a MailPoet plan, you’ll get access to the MailPoet Sending Service.

A free Starter plan is available for those who have 1,000 subscribers or less and would like to use the MailPoet Sending Service. And our paid plans offer features and functionality for those with larger lists who are looking to grow their business using email marketing.

= Use of 3rd Party Services =

To improve user experience, MailPoet may use the following 3rd party libraries if the _Load 3rd-party libraries_ setting is enabled:

* Google Fonts - used in Form Editor which you can use to customize your forms, and in the Email Editor to style emails. This can be individually [disabled by a filter](https://kb.mailpoet.com/article/332-how-to-disable-google-fonts)

* HelpScout - used to show help tooltips throughout the plugin, easily access documentation, and contact our customer support team. This functionality may load scripts from [https://beacon-v2.helpscout.net/](https://beacon-v2.helpscout.net/)

* Mixpanel - used to send data about the usage of the MailPoet plugin when you [agree with sharing usage data with us](https://kb.mailpoet.com/article/130-sharing-your-data-with-us)

* Satismeter - used to ask for feedback.

Loading all these libraries is disabled by default. The option can be enabled in the _MailPoet's Settings > Advanced > Load 3rd-party libraries_.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does MailPoet store the data of the user's subscribers? =

We do not store or keep any data from your subscribers. However, if you're sending with us, we do process all the emails to be sent. It means MailPoet only logs email addresses to ensure that our service runs effectively. We do not track anything else.

= What is the MailPoet Sending Service? =

The MailPoet Sending Service is built exclusively to send WordPress and WooCommerce emails. Our in-house technology provides unparalleled speed (over 50,000 emails per hour) and performance, 99% uptime, and zero loss.

= Which sending methods can I use to send my newsletters? =

You have the liberty to choose how you send your emails: your own host (default, but [not recommended](https://kb.mailpoet.com/article/154-why-you-shouldnt-send-with-your-host)), the MailPoet Sending Service, SendGrid, Amazon SES, or most SMTP providers including MailGun, etc.

= Why should I use the MailPoet Sending Service? =

Our free and paid plans offer unlimited amount of emails.

Our global deliverability rate is 98.5%, often exceeding industry standards. We monitor each and every one of the millions of emails that we send for our users.

Whether you send 10 or 100,000 emails a day, the MailPoet Sending Service routinely handles small business newsletters through to huge mailing lists with tens of thousands of subscribers.

We highly encourage not to send with your host, [here’s why](https://kb.mailpoet.com/article/154-why-you-shouldnt-send-with-your-host).

= Can I filter specific categories out of my post notification? =

Yes! In MailPoet you can set either categories or tags to include/exclude. This allows you to only send posts from specific categories or tags, ensuring that non-relevant posts stay out of your emails. You can also set up multiple post notification emails to better target your subscribers' interests.

= Is MailPoet GDPR compliant? =

Yes, we are GDPR compliant. We do not have a Data Processing Agreement though. Our privacy notice can act as an agreement and GDPR takes this into consideration. By using our service, you acknowledge our Privacy Notice.

We suggest that you also add a link to our Privacy Notice in your own Privacy Notice page. What's important is to make sure that your subscribers are aware that MailPoet delivers your email, if you send with MailPoet that is.

You can also read our [Guide to Conform to GDPR](https://kb.mailpoet.com/article/246-guide-to-conform-to-gdpr).

= WooCommerce: can my customers subscribe to my newsletter at checkout? =

Yes, with MailPoet your customers can subscribe at checkout to your mailing list. You will even be able to send them abandoned cart reminder if they forgot to complete their purchase.

= Is it MailPoet or Mail poet? =

It’s MailPoet, not mail poet. We’ll answer to either though!

= Need help? =
