Promote your business, sell more products, and enhance your customer service with MailPoet’s WooCommerce features.

Use the automated email options to:

* Convert more customers by sending a series of abandoned cart emails.

And with WooCommerce-specific segmentation options, you’ll be able to send targeted emails to your customers based on criteria such as their country, the number of orders they’ve placed, how much they’ve spent, and if they have an active product subscription (powered by WooCommerce Subscriptions) or membership (powered by WooCommerce Memberships).

In addition, you’ll also be able to increase brand recognition by customizing your WooCommerce transactional emails. Create a unified brand experience by changing the layout, colors, and fonts used in your emails, as well as adding any images or additional information to them.

= MailPoet Sending Service =

**The MailPoet Sending Service is free if you only have a few subscribers, with scaling plans available thereafter. [Read more.](https://www.mailpoet.com/pricing/)**

Sending emails and newsletters with your host is not a good idea. You might face sending speed limitations and see your emails ending up in the spam box.

To help your sending go without a hitch, we’ve created an advanced email delivery infrastructure built for WordPress. Our technology allows you to:

* Reach inboxes, not spam boxes
* Send your emails super fast (up to 50,000 emails per hour)
* Maintain your sender reputation and improve engagement levels with automated bounce and complaint handling. Stop sending to non-deliverable and complaining addresses, automatically
* Authenticate your emails (with SPF and DKIM) to improve deliverability and avoid spam boxes.

The MailPoet Sending Service is very easy to set up, you just have to enter a key in your WordPress dashboard and you’re all set!

= MailPoet plans and pricing =

MailPoet is available to download for free. Our free download includes all of the features listed above (with the exception of those indicating a plan requirement) under the following criteria:

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does MailPoet store the data of the user's subscribers? =

We do not store or keep any data from your subscribers. However, if you're sending with us, we do process all the emails to be sent. It means MailPoet only logs email addresses to ensure that our service runs effectively. We do not track anything else.

= What is the MailPoet Sending Service? =

The MailPoet Sending Service is built exclusively to send WordPress and WooCommerce emails. Our in-house technology provides unparalleled speed (over 50,000 emails per hour) and performance, 99% uptime, and zero loss.

= Which sending methods can I use to send my newsletters? =

You have the liberty to choose how you send your emails: your own host (default, but [not recommended](https://kb.mailpoet.com/article/154-why-you-shouldnt-send-with-your-host)), the MailPoet Sending Service, SendGrid, Amazon SES, or most SMTP providers including MailGun, etc.

= Why should I use the MailPoet Sending Service? =

Our global deliverability rate is 98.5%, often exceeding industry standards. We monitor each and every one of the millions of emails that we send for our users.

Whether you send 10 or 100,000 emails a day, the MailPoet Sending Service routinely handles small business newsletters through to huge mailing lists with tens of thousands of subscribers.

We highly encourage not to send with your host, [here’s why](https://kb.mailpoet.com/article/154-why-you-shouldnt-send-with-your-host).

If you're just starting with your newsletter, we offer a free plan to get you started.

= Can I filter specific categories out of my post notification? =

Yes! In MailPoet you can set either categories or tags to include/exclude. This allows you to only send posts from specific categories or tags, ensuring that non-relevant posts stay out of your emails. You can also set up multiple post notification emails to better target your subscribers' interests.

= Is MailPoet GDPR compliant? =

Yes, we are GDPR compliant. We do not have a Data Processing Agreement though. Our privacy notice can act as an agreement and GDPR takes this into consideration. By using our service, you acknowledge our Privacy Notice.

We suggest that you also add a link to our Privacy Notice in your own Privacy Notice page. What's important is to make sure that your subscribers are aware that MailPoet delivers your email, if you send with MailPoet that is.

You can also read our [Guide to Conform to GDPR](https://kb.mailpoet.com/article/246-guide-to-conform-to-gdpr).

= WooCommerce: can my customers subscribe to my newsletter at checkout? =

Yes, with MailPoet your customers can subscribe at checkout to your mailing list. You will even be able to send them abandoned cart reminder if they forgot to complete their purchase.

= Is it MailPoet or Mail poet? =

It’s MailPoet, not mail poet. We’ll answer to either though!

= Need help? =
