// Initialize Editor dependencies that have side effect (meaning they
// not only define module but also modify/register something on load).

// This is to avoid undefined import order & messy WebPack config.
// Code can be gradually refactored to avoid side effects completely.

import 'mailpoet'; // side effect - assigns MailPoet to window
import 'jquery.serialize_object'; // side effect - extends jQuery
import 'public.jsx'; // side effect - assigns to window, sets up form validation, etc.
